K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Know Number Names And The Count Sequence.,Count to 100 by ones and by tens.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Know Number Names And The Count Sequence.,Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1).
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Know Number Names And The Count Sequence.,Write numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0-20 (with 0 representing a count of no objects).
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Count To Tell The Number Of Objects.,Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Count To Tell The Number Of Objects.,"When counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number name and each number name with one and only one object."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Count To Tell The Number Of Objects.,Understand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Count To Tell The Number Of Objects.,Understand that each successive number name refers to a quantity that is one larger.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Count To Tell The Number Of Objects.,"Count to answer how many? questions about as many as 20 things arranged in a line, a rectangular array, or a circle, or as many as 10 things in a scattered configuration; given a number from 120, count out that many objects."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Compare Numbers.,"Identify whether the number of objects in one group is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of objects in another group, e.g., by using matching and counting strategies.1"
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Counting And Cardinality,Compare Numbers.,Compare two numbers between 1 and 10 presented as written numerals.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Operations And Algebraic Thinking,"Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From.","Represent addition and subtraction with objects, fingers, mental images, drawings2, sounds (e.g., claps), acting out situations, verbal explanations, expressions, or equations."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Operations And Algebraic Thinking,"Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From.","Solve addition and subtraction word problems, and add and subtract within 10, e.g., by using objects or drawings to represent the problem."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Operations And Algebraic Thinking,"Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From.","Decompose numbers less than or equal to 10 into pairs in more than one way, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 4 + 1)."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Operations And Algebraic Thinking,"Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From.","For any number from 1 to 9, find the number that makes 10 when added to the given number, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record the answer with a drawing or equation."
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Operations And Algebraic Thinking,"Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From.",Fluently add and subtract within 5.
K,,National Common Core,Common Core,Mathematics,Number And Operations In Base Ten,Work With Numbers 1119 To Gain Foundations For Place Value.,"Compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into ten ones and some further ones, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 18 = 10 + 8); understand that these numbers are composed of ten ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones."
